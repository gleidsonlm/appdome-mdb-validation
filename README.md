# Appdome MobileBot Defense Validation

This is a simple Express.js application that demonstrates how to validate Appdome MobileBot Defense integration.

The application includes endpoints that simulate bot detection and validation.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- npm 9 or later

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the TypeScript sources:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The API listens on `http://localhost:3000`. For hot reload during development, run `npm run dev` instead of steps 2 and 3.
